# Sylheti-Bangla Translation Community

A community-driven project to preserve and bridge the Sylheti dialect and standard Bengali language.

---

## Overview

This is not a traditional translator tool.

Instead, it is a user-contributed platform designed to collect, compare, and grow a community-curated dictionary between the **Sylheti regional dialect** and **standard Bengali**. Users can submit word pairs or sentence equivalents, and over time the system will evolve into a valuable linguistic resource.

## Features

- Submit Sylheti and Bangla sentence pairs  
- Community-driven database building  
- Publicly viewable and growing results  
- Simple UI for fast input  
- Real-time update system (planned)
